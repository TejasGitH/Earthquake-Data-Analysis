# Earthquake Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes global earthquake data using Python. It demonstrates the full data analytics pipeline including data gathering, cleaning, feature engineering, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Highlights
- Download and preprocess real earthquake data from USGS
- Analyze earthquake frequency, magnitude, depth, and locations
- Generate insights through charts using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
- Create a reproducible Jupyter notebook for exploration and presentation

## How to Run
1. Install required packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, jupyter
2. Run notebook `earthquake_analysis.ipynb` step-by-step

## Data Sources
- USGS Earthquake Catalog API
- USGS Monthly earthquake CSV
- Historical datasets from Kaggle

## File Overview
- `earthquake_analysis.ipynb`: Full code and analysis walkthrough
- `data/`: Folder to store raw and cleaned CSV data files
- `figures/`: Charts and plots generated for reports

## License
